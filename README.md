# PasteBinDatabaseManager
A small C# library written in .net 7.0 that allows for a pastebin to act as a "database".
For a code example, please reffer to the demo project inside the src folder.

# Example of a Pastebin Database
```ini
[Person1] Name: SomeGuy1, Age: 18,
[Person2] Name: SomeGuy2, Age: 23,
Name: SomeGuy3, Age: 21,
```
Note that entries dont need to include a so called identifier ( [PersonXYZ] ).

# Future

- Add ability to upload pastes from the library
